Created a candidate application platform that allows users to view job listings, filter jobs based on various criteria, and implement infinite scroll for a seamless browsing experience. 

# Features:
#Job Cards: Each job listing is displayed as a card containing the following information:
-Job title
-Company name
-Location
-Job description (limited to a certain number of characters with an option to expand)
-Experience required
-Apply button/link

#Filters: Implemented filters to allow users to refine the job listings based on:
-Min experience
-Company name
-Location
-Remote/on-site
-Tech stack
-Role
-Min base pay

#Infinite Scroll: Implemented infinite scroll to load additional job listings as the user scrolls down the page. The platform fetches and displays more jobs automatically without requiring the user to click on a "Load More" button.

#Responsive Design:The platform is responsive and works well on different screen sizes, including mobile devices.

#NUll values are handled

# Tech Stack:
-ReactJs
-Redux
-CSS
-Material UI
-Tailwind

# To run the application locally:
1. Install the zip of this repo.
2. run npm install (to install the node modules)
3. run npm run dev (to run the dev server)
